- The variable that gives a non-irregular measure of difference to the mpg values in the dataset is vehicle length and vehicle ground freedom since they altogether affect miles per gallon on the mechanical model. The p-upsides of vehicle weight, spoiler point, and all-wheel drive demonstrate an arbitrary measure of difference with the dataset. 

- The incline of this straight model isn't zero in light of the fact that the p-worth of this model is 5.35e-11 which is more modest than the critical degree of 0.05% and furthermore gives adequate proof to dismiss the invalid speculation. 

= The straight model predicts the mpg of MechaCar models viably on the grounds that the r-squared worth is 0.7149, which implies about 71% of all mpg expectations will be dictated by this model.
